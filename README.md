# VoM-PhyS
VoM-PhyS is a simulation framework to simulate blood flow and heat transfer in biological domains. The repository shared here, consists of codes and example domain used for simulation.

Blood vessels segmented from the imaging data are modeled as 1D flow using Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The 3D tissue is modeled as porous domain, and 1D - 3D flow domain is coupled using Dirac distribution function.

The framework and code free for users to use and modify, but we request you to cite us.
